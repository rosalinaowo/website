			<center><h1>Setup</h1></center>
			<h2>Server</h2>
			<p>
				This website and all the other services I host run on my HP Omen Laptop.
				The OS of my choice is Debian for it's stability and reliability.
			</p>
			<p>
				All of my services use HTTPS and I keep no logs so no one will be spying on you.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you don't want to connect over the clearnet you can use my <a class="purple" href="http://rkkasv5wuz2qy4tk7mkkfbgletefhhdgw7s3tl547if7vilbrozzfhqd.onion/">TOR</a>
				hidden service.
			</p>
			<p>
				Also shoutout to <a href="https://freedns.afraid.org">Free DNS</a>, since I use them as my Dynamic DNS because I don't have a static IP.
			</p>
			<h2>Personal computer</h2>
			<p>
				I use a pre-built desktop with some modifications. (Specs: i7-9700, 16GB 2666MHz, RTX 2070, 
				2.5TB of total storage, MasterLiquid 2X). I daily drive <a href="https://archlinux.org">Arch Linux</a>, 
				but I have Windows installed on another disk and use it only for gaming.
			</p>
			<p>
				As for the software, my browser is Firefox (even though I should use LibreWolf) with a <a href="https://ffprofile.com/">custom profile</a> to 
				disable spyware and other "features", my editors are <a href="https://neovim.io">Neovim</a> and <a href="http://lite-xl.com">Lite XL</a> and 
				I virtualize with KVM.
