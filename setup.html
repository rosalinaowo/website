			<h2>Server</h2>
			<p>
				This website and all the other services I host run on an old Fujitsu Esprimo P500 E85+.
				<br>
				It rocks an i7-2600, 16GB of RAM, a boot SSD and a 2 disk RAID-0 arrray with 3.5TB of capacity.
				<br>
				The OS of my choice is Debian for it's stability and reliability.
			</p>
			<p>
				Also shoutout to <a href="https://freedns.afraid.org">Free DNS</a>, since I use them as my Dynamic DNS.
			</p>
			<h2>Personal computer</h2>
			<p>
				I use a pre-built desktop with some modifications. (Specs: i7-9700, 16GB 2666MHz, RTX 2070, 4.5TB of total storage, MasterLiquid 2X).
				<br>
				I <a href="images/home.png">used to</a> daily drive <a href="https://archlinux.org">Arch Linux</a>, but now I went back to Windows, dual boot is not my cup of tea.
				<br>
				You can browse my dotfiles <a href="https://github.com/rosalinaowo/dotfiles" target="_blank">here</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				As for software, my browser is Brave, my code editors are VSCode and Notepad++, I virtualize with VMWare and listen to music with YT Music.
